**The Wisdom of Ubuntu: "I am because we are"**

This is an **Ubuntu-inspired image fetcher**.  
It connects to the web, fetches shared images, and saves them locally for later appreciation.

## Features
- Downloads an image from a given URL
- Creates a `Fetched_Images` folder automatically
- Saves the image with its original filename
- Handles errors gracefully
